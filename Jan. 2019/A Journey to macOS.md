# A Journey to macOS

***Last edit: 21:01:49 1/18/2019***

For reasons I don't feel like telling, now I'm able to use macOS, and I'll be using it constantly in the near future. It's quite important for me to get familiar with this operating system, which is quite different from Windows. So, I'll lay out some **non-technical** but valuable differences that I think a macOS beginner like me could really use.

## 1. Dock and Menu Bar

## 2. Maximazation, Split View

You must be really familiar with these three buttons on the **upper right side** of a window on Windows.

From left to right, they are "minimize", "maximize", "close". By clicking them you can do these things to a windows.

## 3. Copy, Cut, Paste, Move, Duplicate, Alias

## 4. Installing a Program
