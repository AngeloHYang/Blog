# A Journey to macOS

***Last edit: 19:28:55 1/18/2019***

For reasons I don't feel like telling, now I'm able to use macOS, and I'll be using it constantly in the near future. It's quite important for me to get familiar with this operating system, which is quite different from Windows. So, I'll lay out some non-technical but valuable information that I think a macOS beginner like me could really use.
