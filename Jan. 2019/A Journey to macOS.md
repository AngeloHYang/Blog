# A Journey to macOS

***Last edit: 19:37:40 1/19/2019***

For reasons I don't feel like telling, now I'm able to use macOS, and I'll be using it constantly in the near future. It's quite important for me to get familiar with this operating system, which is quite different from Windows. So, I'll lay out some **non-technical** but valuable differences that I think a macOS beginner like me could really use.

## 1. Dock and Menu Bar

Unlike task bar in Windows, any program that is running on the screen is not on the dock, unless you dock it by pressing "minimize".

## 2. Maximazation, Split View

You must be really familiar with these three buttons on the **upper right side** of a window on Windows.

From left to right, they are "minimize", "maximize", "close". By clicking them you can do these things to a window.

Things are quite different on macOS. First of all, these three buttons are on the **upper left side** of a window. You'll see nothing on the upper right side.

Second, at the first glance of them, you may see something similar to traffic lights.ðŸš¦

Put the pointer close to these buttons, and take a guess, what are they? You can probably tell that the first button stands for "close" and the second button means "minimize", but you might be mistaken because the third button isn't exactly "maximize".

## 3. Copy, Cut, Paste, Move, Duplicate, Alias

You can cut sentences like that in Windows, but you can't cut files.

## 4. Installing a Program
