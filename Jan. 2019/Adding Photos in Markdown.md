# Adding Photos in Markdown

***Last edit: 11:39:00 A.M. 1/4/2019***

There's no need for me to waste time explaining the importance of having photos in your web pages or others. Photos are nowadays everywhere anyway. It is necessary to know how to insert photos in Markdown. More accurately, I'm talking about adding photos in ***Markdown alone***.

## HOW

It's quite easy to do so. All you have to do is add

    ![name of the photo(optional)](link to the photo)

in the place where you want to put a photo.

For example, let's take a look at the photo of Tux below. ![Tux From kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png)

## PROBLEM

However, there's a problem that if the resolution of the photo is too high or too low, the size of the photo on the web page may be too big or too small to view.

Too big:

Too small:

![Alps](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Alps.jpg/80px-Alps.jpg)

## SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM

Is there a way to solve this problem? The answer is yes. But the solution is beyond the topic "Markdown" we are talking about here. So I'll skip it in this article. It's HTML, CSS related, by the way.
