When it comes to creating a web page, the word HTML occurs constantly. As I study further and further, words like Markdown and CSS become familiar to me.

## Summary

### 1. HTML

HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language". According to Wikipedia,

> HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

There are also "instruction text" that determines how these contents in the document shall be displayed, such as the size of a word or in which place paragraph a photo is to be put. We call "instruction texts" in computer text processing "tags".

  According to Wikipedia:

  > In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.
